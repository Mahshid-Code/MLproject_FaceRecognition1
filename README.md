# MLproject_FaceRecognition1 written in MATLAB
Problem Statement: 

Implement the following classifiers for face recognition.

  ML estimation with Gaussian assumption followed by Bayes rule.
  
  Nearest neighbor rule.
  
  PCA followed by Bayes classifier and NN rule.
  
  LDA followed by Bayes classifier and NN rule.

Try different scenarios. For example, you can test the effects of expressions, illumination variations,
etc. You can vary the amount of training data and see how the classification accuracy varies. The list
can go on as you wish.
